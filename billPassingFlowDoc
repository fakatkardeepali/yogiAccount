Bill Passing(Purchase) => Account Voucher

Bill Passing is the process of paying bill against the purchase we have done.
e.g. Yogi Wires is purchasing raw material from their Suppliers
     Yogi Wires need zinc and copper as raw material for manufacturing wires as their product.
     So they purchase zinc and copper from Tata Steel. It is as follows :

     Purchase of 2 items with following quantity:
          Item Name             Quantity  unit      Rate   Amount
          ========================================================
          Zinc                     5       kg       100     500
          Copper                  20       kg       200    4000
          ========================================================
                                               Net Amount  4500      => this should go to Purchase Ledger

          Excise Duty 12.5% (562.5) is applied against Net Amount    => this should go to Excise Duty Against Purchase Ledger
          Freight of Rs.100 is added                                 => this should go to Freight Against Purchase Ledger
          VAT 5% (258.1) is applied against the taxable amount       => this should go to VAT Against Purchase Ledger

          Grand Total = 5420.6                                       => this should go against Tata Steel Ledger

     Against Each BillPassing a New Voucher is generated in Account Project.
          e.g. In above Entry

          New voucher entries will be created against Net Amount,Excise Duty Amount,Freight And VAT but they will not be
          having any Voucher No and they will be having Voucher(against Grand Total) as parent.
