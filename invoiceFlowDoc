Invoice Issue => Account Voucher

(Same case will be applicable for Proforma Invoice,Invoice LC and Purchase Return)

Invoice Issue is the process of billing against the sale we are doing.
e.g. Yogi Wires is selling their wires as product to customers.
     Essar Auto needs Wires for their product manufacturing. So they purchase wires from Yogi Wires.
     Yogi Wires send Invoice to Essar Auto for the sale done. It is as Follows:

     Essar Auto purchased 3 items with following quantity:
     Item Name             Quantity    Rate   Amount
     ===============================================
     Wire Rod 1.0            10        100    1000
     Wire Rod 2.0            20        200    4000
     Wire Rod 3.0            50        10     500
     ===============================================
                                 Net Amount   4500            => this should go to Sale Ledger

     Excise Duty 12.5% (562.5) is applied against Net Amount  => this should go to Excise Duty Ledger
     Freight of Rs.100 is added                               => this should go to Freight Ledger
     VAT 5% (258.1) is applied against the taxable amount     => this should go to VAT Ledger

     Grand Total = 5420.6                                     => this should go against Essar Auto Ledger


     Against Each invoice a New Voucher is generated in Account Project.
     e.g. In above Entry
     Voucher No:21 will be created against Essar Auto Ledger
     New voucher entries will be created against Net Amount,Excise Duty Amount,Freight And VAT but they will not be
     having any Voucher No and they will be having Voucher(against Grand Total) as parent.
